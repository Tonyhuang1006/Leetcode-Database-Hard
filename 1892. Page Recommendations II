You are implementing a page recommendation system for a social media website. Your system will recommended a page to user_id if the page is liked by at least one friend of user_id and is not liked by user_id.

Write an SQL query to find all the possible page recommendations for every user. Each recommendation should appear as a row in the result table with these columns:

user_id: The ID of the user that your system is making the recommendation to.
page_id: The ID of the page that will be recommended to user_id.
friends_likes: The number of the friends of user_id that like page_id.
Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 6        | 1        |
+----------+----------+
Likes table:
+---------+---------+
| user_id | page_id |
+---------+---------+

Explanation: 
Take user 1 as an example:
  - User 1 is friends with users 2, 3, 4, and 6.
  - Recommended pages are 23 (user 2 liked it), 24 (user 3 liked it), 56 (user 3 liked it), 33 (user 6 liked it), and 77 (user 2 and user 3 liked it).
  - Note that page 88 is not recommended because user 1 already liked it.

Another example is user 6:
  - User 6 is friends with user 1.
  - User 1 only liked page 88, but user 6 already liked it. Hence, user 6 has no recommendations.

You can recommend pages for users 2, 3, 4, and 5 using a similar process.

Solution:

WITH t1 AS (SELECT user1_id "user_id", user2_id "friend_id" FROM Friendship
           UNION
           SELECT user2_id "user_id", user1_id "friend_id" FROM Friendship)
SELECT t1.user_id, l1.page_id, COUNT(DISTINCT t1.friend_id) "friends_likes"
FROM Likes l1
LEFT JOIN t1
On l1.user_id = t1.friend_id
LEFT JOIN Likes l2
ON t1.user_id = l2.user_id AND l1.page_id = l2.page_id
WHERE l2.page_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2;
